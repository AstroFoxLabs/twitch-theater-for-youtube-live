This is an extension for Firefox (Worked in the past with Chrome, but I didn't check it since then). 
It changes the Youtube Live Player Layout to be more similar to Twitch's Theater Mode.

# Firefox
- Either use this: https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/twitch-theater-youtube-live/
- Or go to the debug settings and upload the Zip (The files must be directly zipped without a folder in between)

This is an extension for Firefox (Worked in the past with Chrome, but I didn't check it since then) that makes your Youtube Livestreams look like the Twitch Layout in Theater mode.

# Firefox
- Either use this: https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/twitch-theater-youtube-live/
- Or go to the debug settings and upload the Zip (The files must be directly zipped without a folder in between)
